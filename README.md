## Project Specifications 
<p>
The purpose of this Systems Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to provide a detailed description of the Online Clinic Management System (OCMS) web application, this is a condensed version of the document. 
<br><br>
The OCMS is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate efficient management and access of clinic information for registered users, including patients, doctors, and staff. It enables tasks such as user account management, viewing doctors' profiles, lab exam results, prescriptions, creating clinical records, generating reports, and automated email notifications based on lab results. The OCMS aims to improve operations, communication, and data organization within the medical clinic while optimizing performance through data collection and analysis.
</p>

## System Perspective
<p>
The Online Clinic Management System (OCMS) is a web-based application that's meant to improve the efficiency and communication of a small medical clinic. It provides a central platform for managing patient information. Compared to other similar apps, such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems, OCMS is unique in its ability to provide analytics and insights for improving the clinic's performance and health outcomes.
<br><br>
The OCMS will have interfaces with external systems through a web user interface and a database connection. This will allow registered users such as patients, doctors, and staff to access and manage a variety of clinic information.
<br><br>
The OCMS is designed to be used in a single clinic only, so this will be taken into consideration during the development and testing of the system to ensure optimal performance and functionality for that specific clinic's needs.
<br><br>
Constraints include:

●	Data Privacy: The system must have controls to access and use of personal health information, such as lab results.

●	Memory limitations: The system is designed for one location and will need to keep data storage and processing power to a minimum. 

●	Compatibility: The system needs to be compatible with multiple browsers and devices.
